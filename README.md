# Unreal Engine 5 Game Template
 Unreal Engine 5 Game and General Purpose Starter Template.

 This is a Blueprint project (but could also be used as a base for a C++/Blueprint project) that contains many Blueprint classes that will be useful when starting a new project. This was set up to save time and effort when creating a new game or general purpose project.

 This starter template does not cater to a specific type or genre of game, or interactive environment. It is meant as a starting point where you can build your own project from the included assets. 

 All assets are in creative commons or built using Unreal Engine built in functionality.

 The project Contains:

**Blueprints:**
 1. Direct Communication.
 2. Casting (Communication)
 3. Interface (Communication)
 4. Event Dispatch (Communication)
 5. Standalone examples.
 6. Physics Door.
 7. Open Door always away from player.
 8. Light Blueprints.
 9. Arrays.
 10. Functions.
 11. And many other clases.

**Widget Blueprints:**
 1. Core HUD BP (Structure created for controller global HUD Widgets.)
 2. Core HUD Widget Blueprints created.
 3. Standalone Widget Blueprint created.

**Enumerators:**
 1. Example Enum created and controlled via the player controller BP.

**Materials:**
1. Master Template.
2. Dynamic Material.
3. Landscape non-tiling material.
4. Grid Material.
5. The Volumetric clouds have a built in advanced material applied.

**Plugins:**
1. Activated Volumetrics content (for a better cloud material).

**Levels:**
1. Lvl_Blueprint_Sandbox (Displays included blueprints).
2. Lvl_level (Level Template: Includes - Directional Light, Atmosphere, Volumetric Clouds, Sky Light, Exponential Fog and Post Process Volume)
3. Lvl_MainMain (Blank level to load a main menu from).

Folder Structure:
1. The project contains:
2. Unreal Engine Built in Functionality e.g. Third Person Character.
3. Bespoke classes and materials etc..
4. The Bespoke assets are all containned in a top level folder called GameTemplate (this keeps them organised, tidy and also safer to migrate to other projects without risk of overriding files in those projects)
5. The structure follows many guidelines used in this UE style guide: https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide
